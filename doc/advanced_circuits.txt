PCB Tolerances

Inner Layer Clearances 
We require a minimum of 0.010" inner layer clearance.


Copper to Edge of Printed Circuit Board 
Minimum of 0.010" (outer layers) and 0.015" for inner layers (0.020" preferred
for inner layers). For scoring, minimum of .015 for outer layers and .020 for
inner layers.


Pad Size/Annular Ring 
Pad size should be at least + 0.010" over finished hole size for vias and +
0.014" over finished hole size for component holes. This means the annular
ring (radius of the pad) should be at least .005" for vias and a minimum of
0.007" for component holes.


Hole Size 
+/- 0.005"  Standard Spec (applies to holes up to .250", larger holes will be
routed, see Rout tolerances below)
+/- 0.005"  Custom Spec
+/- 0.003" Custom Spec upon request 1 oz and 2 oz finished copper weight and 3
oz finished copper weight (when starting with 2 oz foil) only.
